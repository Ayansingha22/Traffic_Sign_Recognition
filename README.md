# Traffic_Sign_Recognition

A model to recognize traffic signs based on images of various traffic signs used all over the world and act accordingly.

The self driving vehicles would be able to implement this technique to recognize any traffic signals. It would be able to take actions after it has recognized the traffic signs accurately using the model.

The model is trained using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) which consists of input layers fed into a convulational block followed by a dense layers, finally giving the output.

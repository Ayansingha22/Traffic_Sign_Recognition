# Traffic_Sign_Recognition

## Model Architecture
A model to recognize traffic signs based on images of various traffic signs used all over the world and act accordingly.

The self driving vehicles would be able to implement this technique to recognize any traffic signals. It would be able to take actions after it has recognized the traffic signs accurately using the model.

The model is trained using a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) which consists of input layers fed into a convulational block followed by a dense layers, finally giving the output.


## Dataset Information
Here is the dataset for classifying the different classes of traffic signs. There are around 58 classes and each class has around 120 images. the labels.csv file has the respective description of the traffic sign class. 

## Technologies Used
This project was implemented using the following technologies:
pandas: for building the dataframe

TensorFlow and Keras: for building and training the deep learning model.

OpenCV: for image processing.

os: for handling the image files.

Matplotlib: for visualizing the training and validation results
